  summary: Better dates & times for Python
  description: |
    Arrow is a Python library that offers a sensible, human-friendly approach to
    creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates, times, and timestamps.
    It implements and updates the datetime type, plugging gaps in functionality,
    and provides an intelligent module API that supports many common creation
    scenarios. Simply put, it helps you work with dates and times with fewer
    imports and a lot less code.
